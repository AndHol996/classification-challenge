# classification-challenge

***
## Description
This program explores supervised learning with a focus on classification models. It compares two classification models that detect spam from the dataset and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam. The chosen models are a logistic regression model and a random forest model. 

## Project Status
The code is at a stable state. May revise the code in order to further understand supervised machine learning models.

## Conditions
The specifications for this program is that it is running on Python 3.10.14 for a Conda environment and imported pandas and train_test_split, accuracy_score, StandardScaler, LogisticRegression, and RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn.
